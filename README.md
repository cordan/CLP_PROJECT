Constrained Logic Programming
Final project

Topic: GUI Java App which solves two types of coinstrained logic problems

* Cutting Stock problem 
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem
	To find an optimal alignment of "rolls to cutted" on the master
	rolls (e.g. of wood)

* Critical path problem
	Problem taken into account mostly because of comparison of
	problem's analysis between Ant System approach and Coinstrained
	Logic Approach
